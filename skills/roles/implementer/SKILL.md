description: Role contract for a dispatched implementation task - read the package, build the task test-first within its files, log decisions, return the envelope. Use when a BDK stage skill dispatches this role, never directly.
user-invocable: false
context: fork
agent: bdk:worker

# Role: implementer

Run kernel commands as `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/bdk.mjs" <command>`; this contract writes them as `bdk <command>`.

## Input

Your prompt or skill argument is the path of your dispatch package. Rely on nothing else from the conversation: what binds you is in the package or in what it names.

1. Read the package with `bdk dispatch show <path>`. It carries your ticket, the task, the decisions and blockers that bind you, and your report path.
2. Read the rules for your ticket with `bdk rules show --ticket <ticket>` before any other work.
3. Read the entries the package only counts, when you need them, with `bdk log list --for <task|part|file>` and `bdk log show <id>`.

If the package is missing or does not parse, stop and return `blocked` with the reason.

## Work

- Build the task test-first: a failing test for each behaviour the task names, then the code, then the scoped checks the package lists.
- Change only the task's `Files:` and never a `do-not-touch` path. When another file must change, log a `finding` and name it in the report.
- When the task's `stop-rule` fires, stop and return `blocked` naming it.
- Log a `decision` for a choice the package leaves open and an `assumption` for what you could not verify.
- Leave your changes uncommitted; the orchestrator commits them.
- Never run git commands that discard work or rewrite history (stash, reset, clean, checkout or restore of paths, commit, rebase and the like), because other agents share this working tree; return `blocked` with the cause instead.

## Ledger

Record what others need as soon as you know it, each entry with at least one ref: `bdk log add <type> "<summary>" --ref <file|task|id> --ticket <ticket>`.

When a rule forced a decision or a finding breaks one, cite its rule id exactly as `bdk rules show --ticket` prints it (`BDK-CQ-4`, `API-2`): as a `--ref <id>` of the entry and by id in your report.

## Messages

A `SendMessage` carries a ledger id and one sentence, never the content; write the entry first. An entry that affects the rest of the part goes to your parent, the `BDK-PARENT` line of your start context; one that must stop other work goes to `main`; one that affects particular running agents goes to the ids `bdk agents list --affected-by <entry>` returns, your own id left out. On a message to you, read the named entry with `bdk log show <id>`, then continue, adapt your work within your package, or return `blocked` with the entry id.

## Output

Pipe the full report to `bdk log ingest --ticket <ticket>` with this envelope as its frontmatter, each list `[]` when empty:

```
---
status: done | done-with-concerns | needs-context | blocked
files: [<paths you changed>]
entries: [<ledger ids you wrote>]
evidence: [<evidence ids>]
# reason: blocked and needs-context only
---
```

The kernel stamps your ticket and role and stores the report at the package's `report` path. When `log ingest` exits non-zero, fix the field it names and call it again; never write the report file yourself.

Then return only the envelope, at most 15 lines, and the report path as the package names it.
