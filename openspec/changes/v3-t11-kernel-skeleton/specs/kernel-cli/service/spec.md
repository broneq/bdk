# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: bdk doctor

Diagnose the runtime, the layout and the state; one known repair action per finding. The kernel SHALL implement the command as this requirement and its output schema specify.

- **Synopsis:** `bdk doctor [--fix]`
- **Availability:** `read`
- **Mode:** `command`
- **Arguments:**
  - `--fix`. Apply the repairs that need no system change (index rebuild, schema refresh); never installs software.
- **Behaviour:** Checks: Node version (HOST-FACTS `node-sqlite-min`; a line older than 22 is not supported and does not reach `doctor`, the wrapper's STOP line names the minimum instead), the v2 layout with the `bdk import` instruction, spec `bdk-merge-hash` mismatches, index freshness, schema modeline and offline copy. It does not check `uv`, `uvx` or any MCP server: the plugin ships none (ADR-0001). `/bdk:doctor` (T02 decision R-14) runs this and asks before every system change. Exits 0 with `ok: false` when a finding has level `warn` or `fail`, and 0 with `ok: true` and an empty `findings` list when nothing is wrong; exit 5 only when the kernel itself cannot run (`runtime/not-a-repo`). `doctor` is exempt from the Node gate of `kernel-cli`, Invocation: a Node below 22.13.0 is the `node-version` finding with level `fail`, whose `repair` is an install or switch line, never exit 5. `layout` is `v2` when any of `.bdk/settings.json`, `.bdk/runs/` or `.bdk/plans/` exists, which yields the `v2-layout` finding with level `warn`, a `summary` naming the paths found and `repair: bdk import`; `v3` when `.bdk/` holds none of them; `none` without `.bdk/`. The first release (T11) runs the Node and layout checks; the merge-hash, index freshness and schema checks arrive with their owner tasks (T30, T14 / T20, T12), and `--fix` has nothing to repair until then.
- **Writes:** nothing
- **Output:** `schema/cli/output/doctor.json`
- **Exit codes and rules:** `0, 2, 3, 5`. Specific rules: `policy/merge-hash-mismatch`; plus the common rules of every command (`kernel-cli`, Exit codes and the error object).
- **Example:**

  ```bash
  bdk doctor --json
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "ok": false,
    "version": {
      "kernel": "3.0.0",
      "contract": 3,
      "node": "22.12.0"
    },
    "layout": "v2",
    "findings": [
      {
        "id": "node-version",
        "level": "fail",
        "summary": "Node 22.12.0 is below 22.13.0; node:sqlite needs a flag",
        "repair": "nvm install 24 && nvm use 24"
      },
      {
        "id": "v2-layout",
        "level": "warn",
        "summary": ".bdk/settings.json and .bdk/plans/ found",
        "repair": "bdk import"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Owner:** T11
- **Slice:** `service`

#### Scenario: example run

- **WHEN** `bdk doctor --json` runs as in the example
- **THEN** the exit code is 0 and stdout validates against `schema/cli/output/doctor.json`

#### Scenario: policy/merge-hash-mismatch

- **WHEN** a spec file's content hash differs from its `bdk-merge-hash` (V1-7)
- **THEN** the exit code is 2 and the error object carries `rule: policy/merge-hash-mismatch`

#### Scenario: no uv check

- **WHEN** `bdk doctor --json` runs on a machine without `uv` or `uvx` on `PATH`
- **THEN** no finding names `uv`, `uvx` or an MCP server

#### Scenario: v2 layout

- **WHEN** `bdk doctor --json` runs in a git work tree whose `.bdk/` holds `settings.json` and `plans/`
- **THEN** the exit code is 0, `ok` is `false`, `layout` is `v2`, and `findings` holds `v2-layout` with level `warn`, a summary naming `.bdk/settings.json` and `.bdk/plans/`, and `repair: bdk import`

#### Scenario: Node below the minimum

- **WHEN** `bdk doctor --json` runs on a Node below 22.13.0 that loads the bundle
- **THEN** the exit code is 0, `ok` is `false` and `findings` holds `node-version` with level `fail`, the running and the minimum version in the summary, and an install or switch line as the repair

#### Scenario: healthy project

- **WHEN** `bdk doctor --json` runs on Node 22.13.0 or later in a git work tree without a v2 layout
- **THEN** the exit code is 0, `ok` is `true` and `findings` is empty

### Requirement: bdk version

Kernel version, contract version, Node version. The kernel SHALL implement the command as this requirement and its output schema specify.

- **Synopsis:** `bdk version`
- **Availability:** `read`
- **Mode:** `command`
- **Arguments:**
  - none beyond `--json` and `--help`.
- **Behaviour:** The one command that needs no project, no git and no Node minimum: it runs on any Node that can load the bundle, so `doctor` and the wrapper's STOP line can quote it. Text mode prints `bdk 3.0.0 (contract 3, node 24.21.0)`.
- **Writes:** nothing
- **Output:** `schema/cli/common/version.json`
- **Exit codes and rules:** `0, 3`. Rules: `input/unknown-flag`, `input/invalid-argument`; no common rules apply (standalone: no runtime or project check).
- **Example:**

  ```bash
  bdk version --json
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "kernel": "3.0.0",
    "contract": 3,
    "node": "24.21.0"
  }
  ```

- **Owner:** T11
- **Slice:** `service`

#### Scenario: example run

- **WHEN** `bdk version --json` runs as in the example
- **THEN** the exit code is 0 and stdout validates against `schema/cli/common/version.json`

#### Scenario: input/unknown-flag

- **WHEN** a flag the command does not declare
- **THEN** the exit code is 3 and the error object carries `rule: input/unknown-flag`

#### Scenario: input/invalid-argument

- **WHEN** a value has the wrong form
- **THEN** the exit code is 3 and the error object carries `rule: input/invalid-argument`

#### Scenario: Node below the minimum

- **WHEN** `bdk version --json` runs on a Node below 22.13.0 that loads the bundle, outside any git work tree
- **THEN** the exit code is 0 and stdout validates against `schema/cli/common/version.json` with the running Node version in `node`
